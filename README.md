## Topics
Ready to build on your basic Ruby knowledge to start building full web applications? It's time to learn Rails! 

Rails is a framework that makes creating web applications relatively quick and easy. There is a thriving community around it, a strong job market, and ample resources available to beginners. Rails powers applications like Living Social, Groupon, Twitter, Square, Github and more.

### Tech requirements:

 - A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox with Firebug installed.
 - A text editor. Sublime, Visual Studio Code or Atom are good options.
